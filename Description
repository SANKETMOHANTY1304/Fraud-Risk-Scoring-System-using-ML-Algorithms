This project implements an end-to-end fraud detection and risk scoring system using machine learning on highly imbalanced credit card transaction data (0.17% fraud rate). The system focuses on business cost optimization instead of accuracy and simulates a real-world banking risk decision engine.

KEY FEATURES:
Business-driven EDA and data validation
Cost-sensitive learning for extreme class imbalance
Logistic Regression vs Random Forest comparison
Evaluation using PR-AUC and business cost
Threshold optimization to minimize financial loss
Risk score generation (0–100)
Rule-based decision engine:
Auto Approve
Manual Review
Block / Investigate

RESULTS:
Final model: Random Forest
PR-AUC ≈ 0.74
Reduced expected financial loss by ~80%+ compared to no-detection baseline
Optimized decision threshold = 0.15

TECH STACK:
Python, Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
